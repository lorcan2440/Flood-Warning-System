class MonitoringStation:

    '''
    This class represents a water-level monitoring station. There are over 2000 such stations across
    England, which record the water level at fixed locations on various rivers and coastal sites.

    Information on the data collected is available at
    https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/reference#stations.

    ### Inputs

    #### Required arguments

    `measure_id` (str): a unique URL string giving access to the station's latest measurement.

    `label` (str): the name of the station, usually named after the surrounding village or district.
    Not guaranteed to be unique.

    `coord` (tuple): a coordinate pair giving the (latitude, longitude) position in degrees of the
    station. Available to 6 decimal places, or a resolution of < 10 cm in England.

    `typical_range` (tuple): a pair of (smaller value, larger value) giving the interval within which
    the middle 90% of flood level data (in metres) since recording lies, or â‰ˆ1.64 standard deviations
    below and above the mean. Available to 3 decimal places, or a resolution of 1 mm. Can be reliably
    assumed to be constant over time, although not strictly guaranteed.

    #### Optional arguments

    `latest_level` (str, default = None): the most recent water level recorded at this station.
    Recorded in metres and available to 3 decimal places, or a resolution of 1 mm.

    `latest_recorded_datetime` (datetime.datetime, default = None): the date and time when the most
    recent water level was recorded at this station. Usually rounds to the nearest 15 minutes.

    `town` (str, default = None): the name of the nearest town (or named place) to the station.

    `river` (str, default = None): the name of river associated with this monitoring station.

    `is_tidal` (bool, default = False): whether or not this station measures coastal water levels. If true,
    the water level tends to fluctuate periodically by day and night due to the natural effect of tides.

    `station_id` (str, default = None): a unique URL string giving access to its data.

    `url_id` (str, default = None): the RLOI (River Levels On the Internet) ID, used to access the webpage
    associated with the station.

    `record_range` (tuple, default = None): a pair of (min, max) giving the lowest ever and highest ever
    water levels (in metres) since recording for the station began. Recorded to 3 decimal places,
    or a resolution of 1 mm.

    ### Returns

    A `MonitoringStation` instance, which can be passed (either individually or a list of such objects)
    into a variety of API functions available in the separate modules.

class RainfallGauge:

    '''
    This class represents a rainfall gauge. There are over 1000 such Tipping Bucket Raingauges
    (TPRs) across England, which record the amount of precipitation in mm.

    Information on the data collected is available at
    https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/rainfall.

    ### Inputs

    #### Required arguments

    `measure_id` (str): a unique URL string giving access to the gauge's latest measurement.

    `coord` (tuple): a coordinate pair giving the (latitude, longitude) position in degrees of the
    station. Accurate only to the nearest 100 m despite being available to 6 decimal places.

    #### Optional arguments

    `latest_level` (str, default = None): the most recent rainfall reading recorded at this gauge.
    Recorded in millimeters and available to 1 decimal places, or a resolution of 0.1 mm.

    `latest_recorded_datetime` (datetime.datetime, default = None): the date and time when the most
    recent rainfall level was recorded at this station. Typically updates once or twice a day, rounded to
    the nearest 15 minutes.

    `period` (float, default = None): the time between successive readings, in seconds.

    `gauge_number` (str, default = None): a unique identifier (numeric string) for the gauge, used to access
    URLs relating to its readings

    `gauge_id` (str, default = None): a URL giving access to gauge data

    ### Returns

    A `RainfallGauge` instance.
